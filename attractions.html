            <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
            <p>A must-see landmark that offers stunning views of the city.The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel and built for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Standing 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, it was the tallest structure in the world until the Chrysler Building was completed in New York in 1930. The tower was originally meant to be dismantled after 20 years, but it was saved because it became useful for radio transmissions. Today, it attracts over 7 million visitors annually and offers breathtaking views of Paris from its three observation decks.
